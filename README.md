# tcgplayerid_generator
Generate a list of TCGPlayer IDs for corresponding MTG set names and collector number pairs

Very simple HTML page that uses Scryfall API to match a MTG set and the card's Collector Number to generate a list of TCGPlayer_IDs. 

The IDs can be used for inventory tracking, price watch, etc.
